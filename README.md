# Fragmented Picture Naming

**This task was programmed in Presentation (Version 21.1) and requires Presenation software and a license to run this program**

##Overview

A simple task where participants must attempt to name the object slowly revealed to them with as few pieces of information as possible. On each trial, an extremely fragmented picutre is initially presented where most of the information is missing. After a set interval, additional information is revealed, and the process repeats until the entire image is revealed. It is believed that the task taps into global processing ability, as the task requires participants to integrate meaningless indpendent pieces of information into a meaningful whole.

Superior performance would be measured as needing fewer pieces of information to correctly identify the image (i.e. correct identification at higher fragmentation levels). Participants 'buzz in', by pressing the SPACEBAR as soon as they believe they have identified the object, at which point the images disappear and participants type in a response. Participant responses are logged, and require manual checking to determine whether responses are correct or not (though some responses can be automatically scored if they match the internal code for each object).

150 trials are possible, with 10 unique trials presented in up to 15 different blocks.
